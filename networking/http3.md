HTTP/3 - 2019

HTTP/3 is the newest version. It uses a new protocol called QUIC instead of TCP.

Benefits:
1. Faster connection setup. No waiting for slow handshakes.
2. Works better on bad networks (like WiFi or mobile).
3. If your connection drops, it can recover quickly without starting over.
4. Example: When you open a website on your phone and switch from WiFi to mobile data, HTTP/3 keeps the connection alive and loads the page faster.

HTTP/3 is used by big websites like Google, Facebook, and YouTube. Most modern browsers support it.
